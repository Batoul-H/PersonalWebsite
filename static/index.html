            Hi. I’m Batoul, a Bioinformatics pre-medical student at the Lebanese American University. 
            I am also studying towards a minor in Computer Science. 
            As you can imagine, my schedule is pretty hectic. Nevertheless, I do my best to make time for things I enjoy.<br><br>

            I love contemporary literature, this genre dominates my bookshelf, my most recent book being "Before the Coffee gets Cold". 
            I also enjoy rewatching Studio Ghibli movies. While these movies are aimed at a younger audeince, 
            they give me a sense of nostalgia. <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jZNKV5ROBM" target="_blank">Hisaishi’s sweet melodies</a> and Miyazaki’s animations never cease to amaze me. <br><br>

            I adore my cat, Kiwi. You can see him in the gallery section.
            I also read and watch other genres. If you have any book or movie recommendations feel free to drop them in the contact section. ^-^
